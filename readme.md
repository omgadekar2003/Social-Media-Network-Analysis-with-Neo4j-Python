# 📊 Social Media Analysis with Neo4j & Python

## 🌐 Exploring the Graph Database World  

This project harnesses the power of **Neo4j**, a highly scalable graph database, and **Python** to perform **social network analysis**. By leveraging graph analytics, we uncover deep insights into the relationships and behaviors of social media users.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Graph Database Integration:** Uses **Neo4j** for efficient social network storage and querying.  
- **Python-Powered Analysis:** Implements **Cypher queries** and **Python scripts** for data manipulation.  
- **Network Insights:** Identifies connections, communities, and influential users.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Neo4j**  
- **Python**  
- **Py2neo** (Python-Graph API for Neo4j)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and queries  
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for data extraction and transformation  
- `data/` - Sample dataset used for analysis  

## 📖 How to Run  
1. Install **Neo4j** and start the database.  
2. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
